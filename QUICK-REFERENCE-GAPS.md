## 💡 QUICK TIPS

### **Creating Integration Pages**
All integration pages should have:
1. ✅ Connection status badge
2. ✅ Configuration form (API keys, credentials)
3. ✅ Test connection button
4. ✅ Save configuration button
5. ✅ Status display (connected/disconnected)
6. ✅ Recent activity/logs
7. ✅ Help/documentation link

### **Example Page Structure**
```typescript
'use client';

export default function StripeIntegrationPage() {
  const [isConnected, setIsConnected] = useState(false);
  const [config, setConfig] = useState({ ... });

  // Load existing config
  useEffect(() => {
    loadConfig();
  }, []);

  // Test connection
  const testConnection = async () => {
    // Call verify API
  };

  // Save config
  const saveConfig = async () => {
    // POST to /api/integrations/setup
  };

  return (
    <div className="container">
      {/* Status Card */}
      {/* Configuration Card */}
      {/* Test & Save Buttons */}
      {/* Recent Activity */}
    </div>
  );
}
```

### **API Integration Setup Endpoint**
Enhance `/api/integrations/setup/route.ts` to handle all integrations:

```typescript
export async function POST(req: Request) {
  const { type, config, organizationId } = await req.json();

  switch (type) {
    case 'stripe':
      // Save Stripe config
      // Test connection
      // Return status
      break;
    case 'payhere':
      // Save PayHere config
      break;
    case 'woocommerce':
      // Save WooCommerce config
      break;
    // ... etc
  }
}
```
