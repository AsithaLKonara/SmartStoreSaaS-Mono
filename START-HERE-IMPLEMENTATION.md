## 💡 IMPLEMENTATION TIPS

### **Tip 1: Start Simple**
Copy existing working pages and modify them:
```bash
# Copy WhatsApp page as template for Stripe
cp src/app/(dashboard)/integrations/whatsapp/page.tsx \
   src/app/(dashboard)/integrations/stripe/page.tsx
```

### **Tip 2: Use the Integration Manager Component**
Located at: `src/components/integrations/IntegrationManager.tsx`  
This already handles WhatsApp, WooCommerce, and Couriers!

### **Tip 3: API Connections are Ready**
All backend APIs exist. You just need to:
1. Create the UI form
2. Call `/api/integrations/setup` to save config
3. Call integration-specific test endpoints
4. Display status

### **Tip 4: Test as You Build**
Don't wait until the end! Test each page immediately:
- Save configuration
- Test connection
- Verify persistence
- Check error handling

### **Tip 5: Document While Fresh**
Write setup guides as you build each integration:
- How to get API keys
- Configuration steps
- Common errors
- Troubleshooting tips
