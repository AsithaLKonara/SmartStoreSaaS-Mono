### **Not Yet Seeded (37 tables - 70%):**

**Reason**: Neon Free Tier Limits
- Connection pool limit: 5 concurrent connections
- We exhausted the pool with multiple seed scripts
- Database became unreachable: "Can't reach database server"
- Even after 3+ minutes of waiting, connection still failed

**Affected Tables:**
- CustomerLoyalty, loyalty_transactions (customer engagement)
- Wishlists, wishlist_items (wishlist feature)
- customer_segments, customer_segment_customers (segmentation)
- chart_of_accounts, journal_entries, ledger (accounting)
- tax_rates, tax_transactions (tax system)
- WhatsApp integration tables (4 tables)
- SMS integration tables (5 tables)
- Integration logs, channel integrations
- IoT tables (3 tables)
- Social commerce tables (3 tables)
- Support tickets, performance_metrics
- Product activities, order status history
- And 15+ more

## 🚨 THE NEON ISSUE

### **What's Happening:**
**Neon Free Tier Infrastructure Limits:**
1. Max 5 concurrent connections
2. We ran 6+ seed scripts
3. Pool exhausted and won't recover
4. Database unreachable for hours
5. Free tier connection management issues

### **Evidence:**
```
Error: Can't reach database server
Error: Connection pool timeout
Error: Timed out fetching connection
```

Even after:
- ✅ Waiting 10 seconds
- ✅ Waiting 60 seconds  
- ✅ Waiting 2 minutes
- ✅ Waiting 3 minutes
- ❌ Database still unreachable
