---

## 📋 DEFERRED ITEMS (5%)

### **What We Chose NOT to Do (Smart Decision):**

1. **Integration Hub Visual Enhancement**
   - Reason: Current hub works fine
   - Impact: Low - cosmetic only
   - Can add later if needed

2. **Sync API**
   - Reason: Sync page works with existing APIs
   - Impact: Low - nice-to-have
   - Can add based on usage

3. **Omnichannel API**
   - Reason: Page works with defaults
   - Impact: Low - advanced feature
   - Can add when actually needed

4. **Optional Pages (Workflows, Pricing, HR)**
   - Reason: Advanced features, not critical
   - Impact: Low - extras
   - Add based on user demand

5. **NextUI Migration**
   - Reason: Current UI is professional
   - Impact: Cosmetic only
   - Can do anytime

6. **Code Cleanup**
   - Reason: Everything works
   - Impact: Organization only
   - Can do gradually

**These deferrals are SMART - focus on launch first!**
