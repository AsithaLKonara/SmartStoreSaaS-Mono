## ⚠️ **DEPLOYMENT CHALLENGE**

### **Why Vercel CLI Isn't Working Well:**

**PowerShell Output Issue:**
- Vercel CLI commands ARE running
- But PowerShell doesn't show output properly
- Can't see if deployment succeeded or failed
- Makes troubleshooting difficult

**Mac Dependency Issue (FIXED NOW!):**
- Found: `"@next/swc-darwin-x64": "^15.5.4"` in package.json
- Removed it
- Committed the fix
- Should work now!
