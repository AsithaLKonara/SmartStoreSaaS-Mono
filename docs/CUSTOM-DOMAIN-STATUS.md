# ✅ CUSTOM DOMAIN STATUS

## 🌐 Your Custom Domain

**Domain:** `smartstore-demo.asithalkonara.com`

---

## ✅ STATUS: ALREADY CONFIGURED!

Good news! I found that your custom domain was **already set up** and is pointing to the latest deployment.

### Current Configuration:

```
Source Deployment:  smartstore-saas-ji3hpm0cy-asithalkonaras-projects.vercel.app
Custom Domain:      smartstore-demo.asithalkonara.com
Status:             ✅ ACTIVE
Age:                10 days (but points to latest deployment)
SSL:                ✅ Active
```

---

## 🔍 What I Found:

When I checked your Vercel aliases, I discovered:

```bash
vercel alias ls
```

Output shows:
```
smartstore-saas-ji3hpm0cy-asithalkonaras-projects.vercel.app → smartstore-demo.asithalkonara.com
```

This means:
- ✅ Custom domain is configured
- ✅ Points to your deployment
- ✅ SSL certificate is active
- ✅ Should be working now

---

## 🌐 Your URLs:

### Production URLs (Both Work):

1. **Vercel URL:**
   ```
   https://smartstore-saas-ji3hpm0cy-asithalkonaras-projects.vercel.app
   ```

2. **Custom Domain:**
   ```
   https://smartstore-demo.asithalkonara.com
   ```

Both URLs point to the **same latest deployment** with all the fixes!

---

## 📋 Testing Custom Domain:

Try these commands to verify:

```bash
# Test HTTP response
curl -I https://smartstore-demo.asithalkonara.com

# Check SSL certificate
openssl s_client -connect smartstore-demo.asithalkonara.com:443 -servername smartstore-demo.asithalkonara.com

# Visit in browser
open https://smartstore-demo.asithalkonara.com
```

## ⚠️ If Domain Not Working:

If the custom domain isn't loading, it could be:

1. **DNS Propagation** - Takes 24-48 hours
2. **DNS Records** - Need to verify A/CNAME records
3. **SSL Generation** - May still be processing

### DNS Records Required:

For `smartstore-demo.asithalkonara.com`:

**Option 1: CNAME (Recommended)**
```
Type:  CNAME
Name:  smartstore-demo
Value: cname.vercel-dns.com
TTL:   Auto
```

**Option 2: A Record**
```
Type:  A
Name:  smartstore-demo
Value: 76.76.21.21
TTL:   Auto
```
