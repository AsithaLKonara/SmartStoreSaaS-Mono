# üåê CUSTOM DOMAIN SETUP INSTRUCTIONS

## üìä CURRENT STATUS

‚úÖ **Vercel Configuration:** DONE  
‚ö†Ô∏è **DNS Configuration:** NEEDS SETUP

---

## ‚úÖ What's Already Done

I found that your custom domain **is already configured in Vercel**:

```
Deployment: smartstore-saas-ji3hpm0cy-asithalkonaras-projects.vercel.app
   ‚Üì
Custom Domain: smartstore-demo.asithalkonara.com
```

This means:
- ‚úÖ Vercel knows about your domain
- ‚úÖ The deployment is aliased to your custom domain
- ‚úÖ All the fixes are ready to go live on your domain
- ‚úÖ SSL certificate will auto-generate once DNS is configured

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è What You Need to Do

The domain **is not resolving** because DNS records aren't set up in your domain registrar.

### Where is your domain registered?

Your domain `asithalkonara.com` is registered with a domain provider (GoDaddy, Namecheap, Cloudflare, etc.)

You need to add DNS records there.

---

## üîß DNS SETUP STEPS

### Step 1: Login to Your Domain Registrar

Log in to wherever you bought `asithalkonara.com` (e.g., GoDaddy, Namecheap, Cloudflare)

### Step 2: Go to DNS Settings

Find the DNS management section for `asithalkonara.com`

### Step 3: Add DNS Records

You have two options:

#### Option A: CNAME Record (Recommended)

Add this CNAME record:

```
Type:  CNAME
Name:  smartstore-demo
Value: cname.vercel-dns.com
TTL:   Auto (or 3600)
```

#### Option B: A Record

Add these A records:

```
Type:  A
Name:  smartstore-demo
Value: 76.76.21.21
TTL:   Auto (or 3600)
```

---

## üìã EXAMPLE: DNS Record Entry

If you're using **Cloudflare**:
1. Go to DNS tab
2. Click "Add record"
3. Select "CNAME"
4. Name: `smartstore-demo`
5. Target: `cname.vercel-dns.com`
6. Proxy status: DNS only (gray cloud)
7. Save

If you're using **GoDaddy**:
1. Go to DNS Management
2. Click "Add"
3. Select "CNAME"
4. Host: `smartstore-demo`
5. Points to: `cname.vercel-dns.com`
6. TTL: 1 Hour
7. Save

---

## ‚è∞ WAIT FOR PROPAGATION

After adding DNS records:
- **Wait time:** 5 minutes to 48 hours
- **Average:** Usually 10-30 minutes
- **Check status:** Use https://dnschecker.org

### Check Propagation:
```
# In terminal
nslookup smartstore-demo.asithalkonara.com

# Or visit
https://dnschecker.org/#CNAME/smartstore-demo.asithalkonara.com
```

---

## ‚úÖ VERIFICATION

Once DNS propagates, these will work:

1. **Test in Browser:**
   ```
   https://smartstore-demo.asithalkonara.com
   ```

2. **Test with curl:**
   ```bash
   curl -I https://smartstore-demo.asithalkonara.com
   ```

3. **SSL Certificate:**
   Vercel will automatically generate SSL certificate once DNS resolves

## üöÄ YOUR WORKING URLS

### Currently Working (Right Now):
```
https://smartstore-saas-ji3hpm0cy-asithalkonaras-projects.vercel.app
```
‚úÖ This URL has all your fixes and is LIVE now

### Will Work (After DNS Setup):
```
https://smartstore-demo.asithalkonara.com
```
‚ö†Ô∏è Same deployment, but needs DNS configuration

---

## üìû SUMMARY

**What I Did:**
- ‚úÖ Fixed all code issues
- ‚úÖ Deployed to production
- ‚úÖ Configured Vercel to recognize your domain
- ‚úÖ Latest deployment is aliased to your custom domain

**What You Need to Do:**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Add DNS records at your domain registrar
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Point `smartstore-demo.asithalkonara.com` to Vercel
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Wait for DNS propagation (10-30 minutes)

**Result:**
Once DNS is configured, your custom domain will work and show the exact same content as the Vercel URL (with all the fixes we made today).

---

## üõ†Ô∏è QUICK REFERENCE

### DNS Records Needed:

**CNAME (easiest):**
```
smartstore-demo.asithalkonara.com ‚Üí cname.vercel-dns.com
```

**OR A Record:**
```
smartstore-demo.asithalkonara.com ‚Üí 76.76.21.21
```

### Check if Working:
```bash
# Test DNS resolution
dig smartstore-demo.asithalkonara.com

# Test site
curl https://smartstore-demo.asithalkonara.com
```

---

## üéØ NEXT STEPS

1. **Access your domain registrar** (where you bought asithalkonara.com)
2. **Add the CNAME record** (smartstore-demo ‚Üí cname.vercel-dns.com)
3. **Wait 10-30 minutes** for DNS propagation
4. **Test your custom domain** - it will work!

Meanwhile, use the Vercel URL which is **working perfectly right now**:
```
https://smartstore-saas-ji3hpm0cy-asithalkonaras-projects.vercel.app
```

**All your fixes are deployed and ready - just needs DNS setup!** üöÄ
