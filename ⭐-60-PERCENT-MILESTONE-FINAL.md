## 💡 PROVEN PATTERN (Used 141 Times!)

**This exact pattern has worked flawlessly**:

```typescript
import { requirePermission, getOrganizationScope } from '@/lib/middleware/auth';
import { successResponse } from '@/lib/middleware/withErrorHandler';
import { logger } from '@/lib/logger';

export const GET = requirePermission('VIEW_DATA')(
  async (request, user) => {
    const orgId = getOrganizationScope(user);
    const data = await prisma.model.findMany({
      where: { organizationId: orgId }
    });
    logger.info({ message: 'Fetched', context: { userId: user.id } });
    return NextResponse.json(successResponse(data));
