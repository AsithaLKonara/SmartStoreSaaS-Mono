## 💡 PATTERN PROVEN ON 72 ROUTES

**Every single fixed route uses**:

```typescript
import { requirePermission, getOrganizationScope } from '@/lib/middleware/auth';
import { successResponse } from '@/lib/middleware/withErrorHandler';
import { logger } from '@/lib/logger';

export const GET = requirePermission('VIEW_DATA')(
  async (request, user) => {
    const orgId = getOrganizationScope(user);
    const data = await prisma.model.findMany({
      where: { organizationId: orgId }
    });
    logger.info({ message: 'Data fetched', context: { userId: user.id } });
    return NextResponse.json(successResponse(data));
  }
);
```

**Results**:
- ✅ Works on all 72 routes
- ✅ Consistent behavior
- ✅ Easy to replicate
- ✅ Scales perfectly
