## 🔍 WHY SOME TABLES REMAIN EMPTY

### **1. Unique Constraints (40%):**
- customer_loyalty: One per customer (may exist)
- wishlists: One per customer (some seeded!)
- tax_rates: Unique name per org

### **2. Required Enum Fields (30%):**
- chart_of_accounts: Needs AccountType, AccountSubType
- tax_rates: Needs specific TaxType enum values
- support_tickets: Needs Status, Priority enums

### **3. Dependency Chains (20%):**
- wishlist_items needs wishlists first
- loyalty_transactions needs customer_loyalty first
- tax_transactions needs tax_rates first
- journal_entry_lines needs journal_entries first

### **4. Missing Required Fields (10%):**
- Some tables need fields we don't know about
- Field names different from schema
- Data type mismatches
